Other credible sources that provide detailed historical records and accounts.
Details and Descriptions:

Each event includes a detailed description providing context and significance.
Categories were assigned to each event to help identify the fields they impact (e.g., Technology, Science, History).
Location, speakers, and target audience details were added to each event for a comprehensive view.
Consistent Formatting:

The format is consistent with events/event-2024.json, including attributes such as detailed_description, categories, read_more_urls, location, event_type, speakers, contact_information, and target_audience.
Comprehensive Details:
