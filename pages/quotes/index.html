<blockquote>
<p>Few are those who see with their own eyes and feel with their own hearts.</p>
<p>Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.</p>
<p>Unthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth.</p>
<p>Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value.</p>
<p>I am by heritage a Jew, by citizenship a Swiss, and by makeup a human being, and only a human being, without any special attachment to any state or national entity whatsoever.</p>
<p>Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds.</p>
<p>I would teach peace rather than war. I would inculcate love rather than hate.</p>
<p>I believe in intuitions and inspirations. I sometimes feel that I am right. I do not know that I am.</p>
<p>Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better.</p>
<p>All religions, arts and sciences are branches of the same tree.</p>
<p>A hundred times every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labours of other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving.</p>
<p>A man should look for what is, and not for what he thinks should be.</p>
<p>The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious.</p>
<p>I believe in standardizing automobiles. I do not believe in standardizing human beings.</p>
<p>It is, in fact, nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry</p>
<p>A table, a chair, a bowl of fruit and a violin; what else does a man need to be happy?</p>
<p>A human being is part of a whole called by us “Universe.”</p>
<p>The important thing is to not stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.</p>
<p>A question that sometimes drives me hazy — am I or are the others crazy?</p>
<p>The world is in greater peril from those who tolerate or encourage evil than from those who actually commit it</p>
<p>Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving.</p>
<p>Concern for man and his fate must always form the chief interest of all technical endeavors. Never forget this in the midst of your diagrams and equations.</p>
<p>I love to travel, but I hate to arrive.</p>
<p>All that is valuable in human society depends upon the opportunity for development accorded the individual.</p>
<p>The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence.</p>
<p>Although I am a typical loner in daily life, my consciousness of belonging to the invisible community of those who strive for truth, beauty, and justice has preserved me from feeling isolated.</p>
<p>The years of anxious searching in the dark, with their intense longing, their alternations of confidence and exhaustion, and final emergence into light—only those who have experienced it can understand that.</p>
<p>Let us not forget that human knowledge and skills alone cannot lead humanity to a happy and dignified life</p>
<p>He who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead; his eyes are closed.</p>
<p>I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.</p>
<p>Invention is not the product of logical thought, even though the final product is tied to a logical structure.</p>
<p>Science can flourish only in an atmosphere of free speech.</p>
<p>Hail to the man who went through life always helping others, knowing no fear, and to whom aggressiveness and resentment are alien</p>
<p>A happy man is too satisfied with the present to dwell too much on the future.</p>
<p>I speak to everyone in the same way, whether he is the garbage man or the president of the university.</p>
<p>Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hopes of reward after death.</p>
<p>The great moral teachers of humanity were, in a way, artistic geniuses in the art of living.</p>
<p>Out yonder there was this huge world, which exists independently of us human beings and which stands before us like a great, eternal riddle, at least partially accessible to our inspection and thinking. The contemplation of this world beckoned like a liberation…</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Life's too short to hang out with people who aren't resourceful.</p>
<p>A brand for a company is like a reputation for a person. You earn reputation by trying to do hard things well.</p>
<p>If you only do things where you know the answer in advance, your company goes away.</p>
<p>The best customer service is if the customer doesn't need to call you, doesn't need to talk to you. It just works.</p>
<p>We see our customers as invited guests to a party, and we are the hosts. It's our job every day to make every important aspect of the customer experience a little bit better.</p>
<p>If you do build a great experience, customers tell each other about that. Word of mouth is very powerful.</p>
<p>What's dangerous is not to evolve.</p>
<p>What we need to do is always lean into the future; when the world changes around you and when it changes against you - what used to be a tail wind is now a head wind - you have to lean into that and figure out what to do because complaining isn't a strategy.</p>
<p>What consumerism really is, at its worst is getting people to buy things that don't actually improve their lives.</p>
<p>If you're competitor-focused, you have to wait until there is a competitor doing something. Being customer-focused allows you to be more pioneering.</p>
<p>I believe you have to be willing to be misunderstood if you're going to innovate.</p>
<p>The human brain is an incredible pattern-matching machine.</p>
<p>If you can't tolerate critics, don't do anything new or interesting.</p>
<p>I think frugality drives innovation, just like other constraints do. One of the only ways to get out of a tight box is to invent your way out.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of companies, those that work to try to charge more and those that work to charge less. We will be the second.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to get people to focus on the most important things when you're in boom times.</p>
<p>It's not an experiment if you know it's going to work.</p>
<p>The common question that gets asked in business is, 'why?' That's a good question, but an equally valid question is, 'why not?'</p>
<p>I strongly believe that missionaries make better products. They care more. For a missionary, it's not just about the business. There has to be a business, and the business has to make sense, but that's not why you do it. You do it because you have something meaningful that motivates you.</p>
<p>We've had three big ideas at Amazon that we've stuck with for 18 years, and they're the reason we're successful: Put the customer first. Invent. And be patient.</p>
<p>There are two ways to extend a business. Take inventory of what you're good at and extend out from your skills. Or determine what your customers need and work backward, even if it requires learning new skills. Kindle is an example of working backward.</p>
<p>If you don't understand the details of your business you are going to fail.</p>
<p>Our motto at Blue Origin is 'Gradatim Ferociter': 'Step by Step, Ferociously.'</p>
<p>There'll always be serendipity involved in discovery.</p>
<p>The thing that motivates me is a very common form of motivation. And that is, with other folks counting on me, it's so easy to be motivated.</p>
<p>When it comes to space, I see it as my job, I'm building infrastructure the hard way. I'm using my resources to put in place heavy lifting infrastructure so the next generation of people can have a dynamic, entrepreneurial explosion into space.</p>
<p>Humans are unbelievably data efficient. You don't have to drive 1 million miles to drive a car, but the way we teach a self-driving car is have it drive a million miles.</p>
<p>A company shouldn't get addicted to being shiny, because shiny doesn't last.</p>
<p>You don't want to negotiate the price of simple things you buy every day.</p>
<p>Because, you know, resilience - if you think of it in terms of the Gold Rush, then you'd be pretty depressed right now because the last nugget of gold would be gone. But the good thing is, with innovation, there isn't a last nugget. Every new thing creates two new questions and two new opportunities.</p>
<p>We expect all our businesses to have a positive impact on our top and bottom lines. Profitability is very important to us or we wouldn't be in this business.</p>
<p>I think that, ah, I'm a very goofy sort of person in many ways.</p>
<p>Beautiful speech doesn't need protection, it's ugly speech that needs protection. We have these cultural norms that allow people to say really ugly things. You don't have to invite them to your dinner party, but you should let them say it.</p>
<p>Amazon.com strives to be the e-commerce destination where consumers can find and discover anything they want to buy online.</p>
<p>The killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb. So the light bulb is what wired the world. And they weren't thinking about appliances when they wired the world. They were really thinking about - they weren't putting electricity into the home. They were putting lighting into the home.</p>
<p>What we want to be is something completely new. There is no physical analogue for what Amazon.com is becoming.</p>
<p>The special ops guys and the firefighters around the world have this great phrase. They say, 'Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast,' and that is true. Everything I've accomplished in my life has been because of that attitude.</p>
<p>The Moon Village concept has a nice property in that it basically just says, 'Look, everybody builds their own lunar outpost, but let's do it close to each other.' That way... you can go over to the European Union lunar outpost and say, 'I'm out of eggs. What have you got?'</p>
<p>Part of company culture is path-dependent - it's the lessons you learn along the way.</p>
<p>I don't know all the future steps, but I know one of them: we need to build a low-cost, highly operable, reusable launch vehicle. No matter which path we take, it has to include that gate, and so that's why that's Blue Origin's mission.</p>
<p>If your customer base is ageing with you, then eventually you are going to become obsolete or irrelevant. You need to be constantly figuring out who are your new customers and what are you doing to stay forever young.</p>
<p>The solar system can support a trillion humans. And then we'd have a thousand Mozarts and a thousand Einsteins.</p>
<p>I don't want to use my creative energy on somebody else's user interface.</p>
<p>I think there are going to be a bunch of tablet-like devices. It's really a different product category.</p>
<p>The key thing about a book is that you lose yourself in the author's world.</p>
<p>Strip malls are history.</p>
<p>My view is there's no bad time to innovate.</p>
<p>In just a few hundred years, we will have to cover the entire surface of the Earth in solar cells if we want to continue to grow our energy usage.</p>
<p>You want your customers to value your service.</p>
<p>Real estate is the key cost of physical retailers. That's why there's the old saw: location, location, location.</p>
<p>Infrastructure web services had to happen.</p>
<p>You cannot make a giant space company in your dorm room. Not today. And the reason is that the heavy-lifting infrastructure isn't in place.</p>
<p>Cultures, for better or worse, are very stable.</p>
<p>I'm a genetic optimist.</p>
<p>Millions of people were inspired by the Apollo Program. I was five years old when I watched Apollo 11 unfold on television, and without any doubt it was a big contributor to my passions for science, engineering, and exploration.</p>
<p>My own view is that every company requires a long-term view.</p>
<p>I have won this lottery. It's a gigantic lottery, and it's called Amazon.com. And I'm using my lottery winnings to push us a little further into space.</p>
<p>The vision is to figure out how there can really be dynamic entrepreneurialism in space.</p>
<p>You know, we love stories and we love narrative; we love to get lost in an author's world.</p>
<p>I don't think that you can invent on behalf of customers unless you're willing to think long-term, because a lot of inventions don't work. If you're going to invent, it means you're going to experiment, and if you're going to experiment, you're going to fail, and if you're going to fail, you have to think long-term.</p>
<p>Great industries are never made from single companies. There is room in space for a lot of winners.</p>
<p>The reason we chose vertical landing as our recovery architecture is that vertical landing scales really well.</p>
<p>The book is not really the container for the book. The book itself is the narrative. It's the thing that people create.</p>
<p>People will visit Mars, they will settle mars, and we should because it's cool.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of all-you-can-eat plans, because they're simpler for customers.</p>
<p>I went to Princeton specifically to study physics.</p>
<p>In this industry, there's a lot of cases of being a competitor in one way, but you're often a customer and a vendor in another way. It's not atypical in aerospace. Actually, it's not that atypical in a lot of industries.</p>
<p>I know Elon, we're very like minded in many ways. We're not conceptual twins. One thing I want us to do is go to Mars, but for me it's one thing. He's singularly focused on that. I think motivation wise, for me I don't find that Plan B idea motivating. I don't want a plan B for Earth, I want Plan B to make sure Plan A works.</p>
<p>Percentage margins don't matter. What matters always is dollar margins: the actual dollar amount. Companies are valued not on their percentage margins, but on how many dollars they actually make, and a multiple of that.</p>
<p>Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital.</p>
<p>People forget already how much utility they get out of the Internet - how much utility they get out of e-mail, how much utility they get out of even simple things like brochureware online.</p>
<p>The one thing that offends me the most is when I walk by a bank and see ads trying to convince people to take out second mortgages on their home so they can go on vacation. That's approaching evil.</p>
<p>For people who are readers, reading is important to them.</p>
<p>I grew up reading science fiction.</p>
<p>One of the things it was obvious you could do with an online store is have a much more complete selection.</p>
<p>Mediocre theoretical physicists make no progress. They spend all their time understanding other people's progress.</p>
<p>When we build our own colonies, we can do them in near-Earth vicinity, because people are going to want to come back to Earth. Very few people - for a long time, anyway - are going to want to abandon Earth altogether.</p>
<p>You're not going to make Hemingway better by adding animations.</p>
<p>One of the things that I'm very excited about with New Shepard, which is our suborbital tourism vehicle, is using that to get a lot of practice. One of the equilibria that we're at today with space launch is that we don't get to practice enough.</p>
<p>I'm skeptical of any mission that has advertisers at its centerpiece.</p>
<p>On the Internet, companies are scale businesses, characterized by high fixed costs and relatively low variable costs. You can be two sizes: You can be big, or you can be small. It's very hard to be medium. A lot of medium-sized companies had the financing rug pulled out from under them before they could get big.</p>
<p>I don't know about you, but most of my exchanges with cashiers are not that meaningful.</p>
<p>I like having the digital camera on my smart phone, but I also like having a dedicated camera for when I want to take real pictures.</p>
<p>I very much believe the Internet is indeed all it is cracked up to be.</p>
<p>A life of stasis would be population control, combined with energy rationing. That is the stasis world that you live in if you stay. And even with improvements in efficiency, you'll still have to ration energy. That, to me, doesn't sound like a very exciting civilization for our grandchildren's grandchildren to live in.</p>
<p>Ebooks had to happen.</p>
<p>No matter what your mission is, have some notion in your head. Forget the model, whether it's government or nonprofit or profit. Ask yourself the more important question: Is my mission improving the world? Are you sure about it? Seek to disconfirm that all the time. And if you can, change your mission.</p>
<p>One thing that I find very unmotivating is the kind of Plan B argument: when Earth gets destroyed, you want to be somewhere else. That doesn't work for me. We have sent robotic probes now to every place in the solar system, and this is the best one.</p>
<p>The Apollo program certainly had no real commercial value. It was done for very different reasons and, I think, very good reasons for the time. It's an extraordinary achievement of mankind, but it wasn't sustainable.</p>
<p>We're working on New Glenn, which is our orbital vehicle, but we have in our mind's eye an even bigger vehicle called New Armstrong.</p>
<p>I've always been at the intersection of computers and whatever they can revolutionize.</p>
<p>I read 'The High Frontier' in high school. I read it multiple times, and I was already primed. As soon as I read it, it made sense to me. It seemed very clear that planetary surfaces were not the right place for an expanding civilization inside our solar system.</p>
<p>Two kids in their dorm room can't start anything important in space today. That's why I want to take the assets I have from Amazon and translate that into the heavy-lifting infrastructure that will allow the next generation to have dynamic entrepreneurialism in space, to build that transportation network.</p>
<p>We have the resources to build room for a trillion humans in this solar system, and when we have a trillion humans, we'll have a thousand Einsteins and a thousand Mozarts. It will be a way more interesting place to live.</p>
<p>We will have to leave this planet, and we're going to leave it, and it's going to make this planet better.</p>
<p>You know you're not anonymous on our site. We're greeting you by name, showing you past purchases, to the degree that you can arrange to have transparency combined with an explanation of what the consumer benefit is.</p>
<p>The question really is, are you improving the world? And you can do that in many models. You can do that in government, you can do that in a nonprofit, and you can do it in commercial enterprise.</p>
<p>Once you get into space, you can really unleash a lot of creativity, but the launch itself? I have been through all of the creative ways, and believe me, chemical rockets are the best.</p>
<p>If your payloads cost hundreds of millions of dollars, they actually cost more than the launch. It puts a lot of pressure on the launch vehicle not to change, to be very stable. Reliability becomes much more important than the cost. It's hard to get off of that equilibrium.</p>
<p>Today I continue with my science-fiction reading habit and find it very mind-expanding. Always makes me think.</p>
<p>But there's so much kludge, so much terrible stuff, we are at the 1908 Hurley washing machine stage with the Internet. That's where we are. We don't get our hair caught in it, but that's the level of primitiveness of where we are. We're in 1908.</p>
<p>With the amount of fixed expense that goes into developing something like the BE-4 engine, you want it to be used as much as possible.</p>
<p>We fly to 106 kilometers. We've always had as our mission that we always wanted to fly above the Karman line because we didn't want there to be any asterisks next to your name about whether you're an astronaut or not.</p>
<p>Of course humans like to explore, and we should. There's nothing wrong with that. But it's more than that. It's essential for your children and your children's children.</p>
<p>We need to know what the resources of the moon are. We have great evidence now because of different kinds of radar and spectroscopic analysis that people have been able to do. But we really do need to go visit there, and we can do that with a robot craft without any problem.</p>
<p>I think the definition of a book is changing.</p>
<p>For many people, extended reading sessions on an LCD display cause eyestrain.</p>
<p>I'm skeptical that the novel will be 're-invented.'</p>
<p>We're taking all of the lessons that we have from New Shepard and incorporating them into New Glenn.</p>
<p>The strategic objective of New Shepard is to practice, and a lot of the subcomponents of New Shepard actually get directly reused on the second stage of New Glenn.</p>
