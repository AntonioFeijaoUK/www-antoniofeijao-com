### Summary of domains

* Domain 1: Incident Response 12%
* Domain 2: Logging and Monitoring 20%
* Domain 3: Infrastructure Security 26%
* Domain 4: Identity and Access Management 20%
* Domain 5: Data Protection 22%

---

### Domain 1 - Incident Response

1.1 Given an AWS abuse notice, evaluate the suspected compromised instance or exposed access keys.

* Given an AWS Abuse report about an EC2 instance, securely isolate the instance as part of a forensic investigation.
* Analyze logs relevant to a reported instance to verify a breach, and collect relevant data.
* Capture a memory dump from a suspected instance for later deep analysis or for legal compliance reasons.

1.2 Verify that the Incident Response plan includes relevant AWS services.

* Determine if changes to baseline security configuration have been made.
* Determine if list omits services, processes, or procedures which facilitate Incident Response.
* Recommend services, processes, procedures to remediate gaps.

1.3 Evaluate the configuration of automated alerting, and execute possible remediation of security related incidents and emerging issues.

* Automate evaluation of conformance with rules for new/changed/removed resources.
* Apply rule-based alerts for common infrastructure misconfigurations.
* Review previous security incidents and recommend improvements to existing systems.

---

### Domain 2 - Logging and Monitoring

2.1 Design and implement security monitoring and alerting.

* Analyze architecture and identify monitoring requirements and sources for monitoring statistics.
* Analyze architecture to determine which AWS services can be used to automate monitoring and alerting.
* Analyze the requirements for custom application monitoring, and determine how this could be achieved.
* Set up automated tools/scripts to perform regular audits.

2.2 Troubleshoot security monitoring and alerting.

* Given an occurrence of a known event without the expected alerting, analyze the service functionality and configuration and remediate.
* Given an occurrence of a known event without the expected alerting, analyze the permissions and remediate.
* Given a custom application which is not reporting its statistics, analyze the configuration and remediate.
* Review audit trails of system and user activity.

2.3 Design and implement a logging solution.

* Analyze architecture and identify logging requirements and sources for log ingestion.
* Analyze requirements and implement durable and secure log storage according to AWS best practices.
* Analyze architecture to determine which AWS services can be used to automate log ingestion and analysis.

2.4 Troubleshoot logging solutions.

* Given the absence of logs, determine the incorrect configuration and define remediation steps.
* Analyze logging access permissions to determine incorrect configuration and define remediation steps.
* Based on the security policy requirements, determine the correct log level, type, and sources.

### Domain 3 - Infrastructure Security

3.1 Design edge security on AWS.

* For a given workload, assess and limit the attack surface.
* Reduce blast radius (e.g. by distributing applications across accounts and regions).
* Choose appropriate AWS and/or third-party edge services such as WAF, CloudFront and Route 53 to protect against DDoS or filter application-level attacks.
* Given a set of edge protection requirements for an application, evaluate the mechanisms to prevent and detect intrusions for compliance and recommend required changes.
* Test WAF rules to ensure they block malicious traffic.

3.2 Design and implement a secure network infrastructure.

* Disable any unnecessary network ports and protocols.
* Given a set of edge protection requirements, evaluate the security groups and NACLs of an application for compliance and recommend required changes.
* Given security requirements, decide on network segmentation (e.g. security groups and NACLs) that allow the minimum ingress/egress access required.
* Determine the use case for VPN or Direct Connect.
* Determine the use case for enabling VPC Flow Logs.
* Given a description of the network infrastructure for a VPC, analyze the use of subnets and gateways for secure operation.

3.3 Troubleshoot a secure network infrastructure.

* Determine where network traffic flow is being denied.
* Given a configuration, confirm security groups and NACLs have been implemented correctly.

3.4 Design and implement host-based security.

* Given security requirements, install and configure host-based protections including Inspector, SSM.
* Decide when to use host-based firewall like iptables.
* Recommend methods for host hardening and monitoring.

---

### Domain 4 - Identity and Access Management

4.1 Design and implement a scalable authorization and authentication system to access AWS resources.

* Given a description of a workload, analyze the access control configuration for AWS services and make recommendations that reduce risk.
* Given a description how an organization manages their AWS accounts, verify security of their root user.
* Given your organisation’s compliance requirements, determine when to apply user policies and resource policies.
* Within an organisation’s policy, determine when to federate a directory services to IAM.
* Design a scalable authorization model that includes users, groups, roles, and policies.
* Identify and restrict individual users of data and AWS resources.
* Review policies to establish that users/systems are restricted from performing functions beyond their responsibility, and also enforce proper separation of duties.

4.2 Troubleshoot an authorization and authentication system to access AWS resources.

* Investigate a user’s inability to access S3 bucket contents.
* Investigate a user’s inability to switch roles to a different account.
* Investigate an Amazon EC2 instance’s inability to access a given AWS resource.

## Domain 5 - Data Protection

5.1 Design and implement key management and use.

* Analyze a given scenario to determine an appropriate key management solution.
* Given a set of data protection requirements, evaluate key usage and recommend required changes.
* Determine and control the blast radius of a key compromise event and design a solution to contain the same.

5.2 Troubleshoot key management.

* Break down the difference between a KMS key grant and IAM policy.
* Deduce the precedence given different conflicting policies for a given key.
* Determine when and how to revoke permissions for a user or service in the event of a compromise.

5.3 Design and implement a data encryption solution for data at rest and data in transit.

* Given a set of data protection requirements, evaluate the security of the data at rest in a workload and recommend required changes.
* Verify policy on a key such that it can only be used by specific AWS services.
* Distinguish the compliance state of data through tag-based data classifications and automate remediation.
* Evaluate a number of transport encryption techniques and select the appropriate method (i.e. TLS, IPsec, client-side KMS encryption).
