Message from the organisation: 

```txt
"Many thanks for your booking.

Please note that all players must complete an Online Registration Form before they are allowed to play.

This should be done before arriving at the centre so as to ensure smooth entry on the day of your event.

Completing registration in advance allows you to start playing sooner, and mobile reception may be limited at the centre and therefore your registration process may be difficult to complete on the day.

To complete your Online Registration Form please click the button below.
  
    (Antonio to share the link in private)

This email can be forwarded on to your other players, or you can forward the link to your unique Online Registration Portal to your group via SMS, Facebook or WhatsApp by copying the link below.


Once you have completed your Online Registration Form you can click the Home button in the top left corner of the registration portal and then click the yellow Registered button in the top right corner to see a list of all of the registered players. If there are any players yet to register then please remind them in advance so as to fast track your arrival on the day.


If you have any further queries do not hesitate to give me a call or email me.

Kind regards,
Nancy Mills
Event Co-ordinator
