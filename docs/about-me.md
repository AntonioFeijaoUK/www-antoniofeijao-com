I’m a seasoned professional with over 16 years of expert-level experience in Linux, networking, cybersecurity, and infrastructure.

I hold AWS Specialty certifications in Advanced Networking and Security, as well as Professional Architect and DevOps certifications.

Over the past 8 years, I’ve specialised in AWS security, automation, networking, and infrastructure at an expert level.

My expertise extends to engineering and architecture roles with CrowdStrike and Cloudflare, alongside offensive security and penetration testing experience. I also lead deep-dive technical demos and mentor others, helping to cultivate the next generation of tech professionals.

Outside of tech, I’m passionate about space physics, scientific exploration, and time travel theories.

I keep active with running, swimming, snowboarding, skiing, and tackling Tough Mudder challenges. Motorbiking and outdoor adventures are a big part of my life as well.

Though I’m not very active on social media, I’m an avid listener of tech, cybersecurity, and history podcasts.

I appreciate a good movie—particularly superhero films, science documentaries, and sci-fi comedies.

Travel and family are central to my life.
