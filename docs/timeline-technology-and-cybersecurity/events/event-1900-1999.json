While conducting experiments at St. Mary's Hospital in London, Fleming observed that a mold called Penicillium notatum had killed bacteria in a petri dish. This accidental discovery led to the development of penicillin as a powerful antibiotic, transforming the treatment of bacterial infections and saving countless lives. Fleming's work laid the foundation for the antibiotic revolution, profoundly impacting the field of medicine and revolutionizing healthcare worldwide.",
