Welcome to my page, and thank you for taking the time to learn more about me.

My name is Antonio Feijao and I live in the United Kingdom (`UK`), thefore the `Antonio Feijao UK`

I am a Security Architect with over 16 years of expert-level experience in cybersecurity, networking, and infrastructure.

I believe that security is a shared responsibility, and one of my core values is empowering others.

I have spent years mentoring professionals and leading technical deep-dive demos to help teams understand the intricacies of cybersecurity.

Whether we are discussing penetration testing techniques, setting up Zero Trust authentication, or diving into the world of threat hunting, my approach is always to simplify complex topics so that others can apply what they learn in real-world scenarios.

I am also the founder of (not public yet, WORK-IN-PROCESS), a cybersecurity education and defence platform aimed at helping professionals and aspiring individuals develop a deeper understanding of security practices.

(not public yet, WORK-IN-PROCESS) is built on the principles of trust, professionalism, and continuous learning.

My teaching philosophy is rooted in practical, hands-on learning.

Cybersecurity is not just about understanding the latest threats but about applying critical thinking to anticipate and prevent them.

I take pride in showing real-world examples of risks and providing actionable solutions that professionals can implement to strengthen their security posture.

Whether you are an experienced professional looking to expand your skills or just starting your journey in cybersecurity, I am here to support your growth.

My goal is to foster a community of learners who are confident, informed, and prepared to tackle the security challenges of today and tomorrow.

Let us work together to build a safer digital world.
