Blocking advertising and pops using hosts file

Full script file on github [block-ads-v3.sh](https://github.com/AntonioFeijaoUK/www.antoniocloud.com/blob/master/docs/linux/block-ads-v3.sh)

!!! note
    Remember, do not execute or run what you do not understand, use at your own risk!

```sh
#!/bin/bash

#
# Version 2018-11-09 11:24
# Author #AntonioFeijaoUK
#
# Purpose:	Script to automate the update on /etc/hosts with entries about malicious or advertising domains sites,
# 			so that my computer or DNS-Server resolves these domains to 0.0.0.0, therefore avoiding/blocking the connection.
#
# Result:	"Cleaner" web-pages, safer navigation, faster loading pages as the extra mess/ads will not download.
#
# Updates:
#   2019-02-06 - Updated clean up script  awk '{print $1}'
