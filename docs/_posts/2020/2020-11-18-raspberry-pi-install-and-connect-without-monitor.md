The purpose of this post is to briefly show how to install the [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/) into a new microSD card using a laptop or desktop. Then boot the `Raspberry Pi` with this microSD card.

The `Raspberry Pi` will automatically connect to your wifi and the `ssh tcp/22` service should be running, which will allow you to connect via `ssh`.

No need for a monitor to be connected to the `Raspberry Pi`.

Using the laptop or desktop, in the command line, the `dd`command will copy the [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/) into the microSD card.

After the `dd` command, 2 files need to be added to the `/boot` folder in the microSD card.

    - One empty file named `ssh`

    - One file named `wpa_supplicant.conf` with your wireless configuration

example for the `wpa_supplicant.conf` file

```
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=GB

network={
scan_ssid=1
ssid="MY_WIFI_NAME"
psk="MY_WIFI_PASSWORD"
}
```

!!!NOTE
    If you have multiple `wlan interfaces`, you can use one file per interface, example `wpa_supplicant-wlan1.conf`

## Step-by-step detail

### Step 1 - Download

* Download the [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/) version of your choice.

### Step 2 - Unzip

* Unzip the [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/) version you downloaded.

### Step 3 - Copy

* Copy the [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/) into the microSD card.

  * Make sure there are no mount folders.

> **IMPORTANT** - the `dd` command will `delete everything in the microSD card` - make sure you know what you are doing! Otherwise stop here or follow the official guidance [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md).

I am using the `dd` command.

`sudo dd bs=1m if=path_of_your_image.img of=/dev/rdiskN; sync`

* Example of my `dd` command running

```
dd bs=1m if=2020-08-20-raspios-buster-armhf-lite.img of=/dev/rdisk2; sync
1760+0 records in
1760+0 records out
1845493760 bytes transferred in xxxxxxx secs (xxxxxxx bytes/sec)
```

### Step 4 - add files into the boot folder

After the copy, the first partition in the microSD card, is usualy automatically mounted `/boot`.

Now, all I need to do, is to copy the files that I already have on my laptop into this `/boot` folder.

I just have to `drag-and-drop` (or `copy` and `paste`) then into the `/boot` folder.

* One empty file named `ssh`

    `ssh`
    
* One file named `wpa_supplicant.conf` with your wireless configuration

```
country=GB
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
scan_ssid=1
ssid="MY_WIFI_NAME"
psk="MY_WIFI_PASSWORD"
}
```

if you cannot copy the files, why not use the command line?

```
cd /Volumes/boot

touch ssh

vim wpa_supplicant.conf << and add the content in here

```


## Power on Raspberry PI Conclusion

And that's it :)

Now, eject the microSD card from your laptop, put it in the Raspberry Pi and on boot the Raspberry Pi, it should connect to your wifi.

To connect via `ssh` you need to find the `ip address` that was allocated to the Raspberry Pi.

Usually, you can easy find the `ip address` in your `home router` connected devices.

Alternativelly, if you have [nmap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nmap) installed your your laptop (or on another Raspberry Pi), you can `scan` your network for devices with `tcp/ssh port 22` open.

example for the `nmap` command

{% highlight bash %}

## searching for new device on local network

nmap -sT -p22 --open 192.168.1.0/24 # ( CHANGE FOR YOUR OWN SUBNET)

(...)
Nmap scan report for `raspberrypi.home.local` (192.168.1.238)  
Host is up (0.042s latency).
(...)


## Connect to raspberrypi.home.local

ssh pi@192.168.1.238

default username `pi`
default password `rasbperry`


## Change pi default password 

pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo passwd pi
New password:
Retype new password:
passwd: password updated successfully


## Update and configure for your needs

pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo raspi-config
  
  
{% endhighlight %}
