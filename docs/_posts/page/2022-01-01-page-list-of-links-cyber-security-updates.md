* <https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/threat-intelligence-lifecycle/> - Threat Intelligence Lifecycle
* The threat intelligence lifecycle is considered to comprise five stages, each of which helps to ensure quality CTI data which can be utilised to support cyber defence.
  * 1) Planning and direction: Set the scope and objectives for core intel roles and processes.
  * 2) Collection: Deploy data gathering and processing techniques and sources.
  * 3) Analysis: Translate raw intel into meaningful and taxonomized actors, events, and attributes.
  * 4) Production: Assess intel significance and severity based on business and environmental context.
  * 5) Dissemination and feedback: Report on finished intel, considering urgency and confidentiality.

* Planning and direction
  This stage involves defining a business strategy and goals which the CTI program will support.<br>
  It will cover the information and processes to be protected, priorities, and CTI required to complete this goal.

* Collection
  This stage involves defining what information should be collected in order to resolve a full picture of the threat landscape.<br>
  Threat data will be collected from numerous sources and formats; this data will need to be deduplicated and normalised before use.

* Analysis
  The analysis stage of the CTI lifecycle involves analysts processing the collected data against the guidance and requirements laid out in the planning and direction stage.<br>
  The analysis should determine the reliability and relevance of the data collected.

* Production
  The results of the analysis stage should be delivered to the necessary teams within the organisation.<br>
  The CTI should be distributed to stakeholders in a manner which is suitable for consumption, whether this is a report, presentation, or other format.

* Dissemination and feedback
  Teams that receive CTI should be part of the CTI lifecycle.<br>
  They should report whether the information proved to be valuable against the goals laid out in the planning and direction stages.<br>
  This feedback will be used in the next planning and direction cycle stage.
