## What is OSINT

Open-source intelligence is a **multi-methods methodology** for collecting, analysing and making decisions about data accessible in publicly available sources to be used in an intelligence context.

In the intelligence community, the term "open" refers to overt, publicly available sources.

## Taking effective notes

.... multiple option for Windows, Linux and Mac... I am happy with notes on this post :)

## Sock Puppets

Online face account or identity, sample a fake twitter account...

Should never tie back to you, to your IP...

Your "sock puppets" account should look "real", stories and posts...
