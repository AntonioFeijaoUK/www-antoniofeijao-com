## Intro to Python3 environments

While using Python, you might want to use a separate environment to keep `pip` packages separate from other environments  
or separate from your main operation system.

Python virtual environments is on of the options for that.  
Of course you could use containers but here I just want a quick and simple virtual environment to run python code.


Official page and documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>

## Python 3 creating a virtual environment

`python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment`

`-m` use for python module
`venv` virtual environment module
`/path/to/new/virtual/environment` folder/directory for the virtual environment

Happy learning!
